# Solving-ODEs-using-PINNs

The notebook you can find here is intended as a concise introduction to the thrilling topic of using $Physically \hspace{1mm} Informed \hspace{1mm} Neural \hspace{1mm} Networks$ (PINNs) to solve $Ordinary \hspace{1mm} Differential \hspace{1mm} Equations$ of various orders. These ODEs stem from well knwon physical systems or phenomena and can be solved either analytically or numerically employing classical numerical integration methods like Runge-Kutta of $4^{th}$ order. The aim of the exercises shown here is to enable students to: build a PINN, tune the hyperparameters, and many more.
